# The-Berkeley-Group

I consulted for [Urban Ed Academy (UEA)](https://urbanedacademy.org/) during my first semester at The Berkeley Group. UEA is a nonprofit with a mission to diversify teacher demographics in elementary schools so that every child is represented. They have an educator fellowship program that funds housing for first-time URM teachers. They were looking for recommendations on where and how to expand this program in the Bay Area. 

Using Tableau, I created an interactive map visualization to locate areas for future expansion based on three categories: school demographics, rent prices, and community center locations. [This visualization can be found here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tanushree.jain/viz/UEA_School_and_Housing_Final/FinalPresentation?publish=yes).
